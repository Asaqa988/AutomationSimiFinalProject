🚀 How to Run Specific Test Cases
Each test method inside AppTest.java has a specific purpose. Tests are disabled (enabled = false) by default except DownloadApp.
You can enable any test by setting enabled = true.

Example:


@Test(priority = 1, enabled = true)
public void RadioButton() {
    ...
}
📋 List of Test Cases

Priority	Test Name	Description
1	RadioButton	Selects a random radio button.
2	AutoCompleteTest	Tests auto-complete text input with random country.
3	SelectTag	Selects an option from a dropdown menu.
4	CheckBoxTest	Clicks on random checkboxes.
5	Window_Example	Handles switching between multiple windows.
6	Switch_Tab_Example	Handles switching between tabs.
7	AlertTest	Tests alert pop-up and accepts it.
8	ConfirmTest	Tests confirm pop-up and dismisses it.
9	TableTest	Reads and prints table data.
10	HideAndShow	Tests hiding and showing a text field.
11	EnableDisable	Tests disabling and enabling an input field.
12	MouseHover	Tests mouse hover actions and click inside dropdown.
13	Calendar	Clicks on the calendar tab and extracts table data.
14	Iframe	Switches into an iframe and interacts with it.
15	DownloadApp	Tests clicking a link to download APK files.
❗ Important Notes
Randomization is used in some tests (e.g., random radio button, random checkbox selection).

Window and Tab Management are used — make sure your pop-up blocker is disabled.

Some interactions need scrolling — handled via JavaScriptExecutor.

Wait times are introduced using Thread.sleep() for demo purposes; it's recommended to use explicit waits (like WebDriverWait) in real-world projects.
